# GrandlineBattlegrounds

This project contains the core scripts and modules for the game. To ensure all required `RemoteEvent` objects exist when running in a fresh place, the server script at `ServerScriptService/Misc/RemoteSetup.server.lua` will create any missing remotes inside `ReplicatedStorage/Remotes`.

Several core server scripts emit initialization messages to the output so you can confirm they are running.
